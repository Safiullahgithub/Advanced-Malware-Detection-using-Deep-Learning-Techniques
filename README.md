# Advanced-Malware-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

# Background:
To address the challenge of identifying sophisticated malware that evades traditional detection methods, this project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for improved malware detection accuracy and efficiency.

# Dataset:
The Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (MMCC) dataset, consisting of harmful and benign executable files, will be used. With approximately 9 million samples representing different malware families, the dataset will be extracted from the official MMCC repository.

# Feature Creation and Selection:
Static and dynamic analysis techniques will be employed to extract features. Static features like file size, entropy, and opcode sequences will be extracted, while dynamic features will include API call sequences, system call patterns, and behavioral analysis data. Feature selection will be performed using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and feature importance ranking.

# Method:
Deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and hybrid models like CNN-LSTM architectures, will be implemented. TensorFlow and Keras will be utilized for model development and training, with Python as the primary programming language.

# Evaluation:
A 10-fold cross-validation approach will be employed to assess the performance of deep learning models in malware identification. Additionally, an independent holdout dataset will be used to ensure model generalization. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC will be employed. Comparisons with baseline classifiers and state-of-the-art malware detection methods will be conducted.
